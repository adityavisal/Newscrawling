Ravichandran Ashwin took 3-22 for a rampant India.</p> <p>India finished at the top of Group 2 to tee up a last-four clash with England, who finished second in Group 1.

The day had started, after all, with the Netherlands upsetting South Africa to upend all predictions in Group 2, but a brutally dominating performance ensured that India ended as group toppers. They will now play England in the second semifinal at the Adelaide Oval next Thursday.Surya’s repertoire of audacious strokeplay, all powerful wrists and maddening angles even as he chases perfection at the point of contact, was on view as India, batting first, exploded to 186/5 in 20 overs after another sedate start. The scoops, the sweeps, the pick-up shots, the lofted drives all melted into one in a maverick display of T20 batting genius. Before Suryakumar, the possibility of routinely pulling off such shots, with such immaculate placement, was perhaps only in the realm of imagination.Zimbabwe’s hapless bowlers watched even as their slower ones and cutters disappeared into the stands. Surya ended with a strike rate of 244 and the fourth fastest 50 (off 23 balls) for India in T20 World Cups. India scored 79 off the last five overs, with ‘SKY’ scoring his last 56 runs off 19 balls. This was Suryakumar’s sixth innings of 50-plus at a strike rate of 200 or above in T20Is, making him, of course, the first Indian to achieve the feat. It was as if Suryakumar brought a fly swatter, not a bat, to brush the bowlers aside. By the end of 15 overs, India were plodding along at 7. 13, with Suryakumar and Hardik feeling their way in the middle.The return of Blessing Muzarabani’s pace, though, woke up ‘SKY’ as he unfurled his full range of strokes: second ball of the 16th, an ugly thick edge over the ’keeper. Not pretty but a boundary. Next ball, driven on the up to beat mid-off. Another four. Hardik too came into his own and the over yielded 18 runs.Surya’s onslaught picked up more steam in the 17th over, bowled by the left-armer Richard Ngarava : a wide full toss guided over the third man fence. Third ball, a six, the pick-up shot this time over backward square.Next over, a wide slow off-cutter from Tendai Chatara scooped over short fine, and then a powerful hit over extra cover for six to close out the over. Twelve off the 17th, 15 off the 18th. The next over, Muzarabani bowls a slow yorker at SKY’s legs, only to see the batter make room and use those magical wrists to hammer it straight down.Two sixes and a four followed in the 20th, the last six, off the last ball from Ngarava, a wide yorker unbelievably played over his shoulder, ‘SKY’ nearly tumbling over but ensuring that everything was perfect at the point of contact.The Surya magic bewitched Zimbabwe. Batting hasn’t been their strong suit in this tournament and when Bhuvneshwar got Madhevere first ball with an away swinger, the writing was on the wall. By the end of the Powerplay Zimbabwe were 28/3 and by the 9th over, they were 47-5. Any semblance of a contest was effectively over.Only Sikandar Raza yet again played lone ranger with a 24-ball 34 as Zimbabwe reached 115 before losing all their wickets in 17.2 overs. This was a good workout for India ahead of the knockouts and the win will keep them in a good headspace ahead of the England game.In the end, it was Suryakumar’s pyrotechnics, perfectly suited to the colour and noise of T20s, that won the day for the 82,507 in attendance at the ‘G’.\",\n",

Others were let go before management realized that their work and experience may be necessary to build the new features Musk envisions, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.Twitter cut close to 3,700 people this week via email as a way to trim costs following Musk’s acquisition, which closed in late October. Many employees learned they lost their job after their access to company-wide systems, like email and Slack, were suddenly suspended. The requests for employees to return demonstrate how rushed and chaotic the process was.A Twitter spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment. Twitter’s plan to hire back workers was previously reported by Platformer.“Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day,” Musk tweeted on Friday.Twitter has close to 3,700 employees remaining, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk is pushing those who remain at the company to move quickly in shipping new features, and in some cases, employees have even slept at the office to meet new deadlines.Over the weekend, Twitter rolled out a new Twitter Blue subscription plan, offering a verification check mark for any user who pays $8 a month. The company also said it will soon be launching other features, including half the ads, the ability to post longer videos and get priority ranking in replies, mentions and searches.The New York Times on Sunday reported Twitter will delay changes to the check marks until after Tuesday’s midterm elections, after users and employees raised concerns that the plan could be misused to sow discord.',\n",

They are generally offered contracts of 6-12 months which are not renewed when the digitisation work in one area has been completed,” he added.\\n\\nThe Morning Context was the first to report the development.\\n\\nThis is the second round of layoffs at Udaan in the space of a few months. In June, the company had let go of around 180 employees.\\n\\n“As we move forward in our journey towards making Udaan a profitable company, the efficiency enhancement drive and the evolution in business model have created some redundancies in the system, with some roles no longer required. As a responsible organisation, we are working towards providing all requisite support to the impacted employees,” said an Udaan spokesperson.\\n\\nIn an e-mail to employees last month, chief financial officer Aditya Pandey had said that the company is getting ready to go public in the next 12-18 months. He said that Udaan’s unit economics had improved by approximately 1,000 basis points, with equally strong improvements in both gross margins and operating cost. This, he claimed, has translated into a 60 percent-plus reduction in cash-burn.\\n\\nUdaan has raised $350 million of financing through debt and convertible notes in the last four quarters. It had last raised equity funding in January 2020, when it was valued at $3.1 billion. Its investors include DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and GGV Capital, among others.\\n\\nNotably, the e-commerce unicorn’s valuation crawled from $2.8 billion in 2019 to $3 billion in January 2021 compared to other e-commerce peers – unlike its previous euphoric rise – during the pandemic.\\n\\nFounded in 2016 by three former executives of Flipkart -- Vaibhav Gupta, Amod Malviya, and Sujeet Kumar -- the company has operations across categories including lifestyle, electronics, home & kitchen, staples, fruits & vegetables, FMCG, pharma, toys, and general merchandise.\\n\\nIn September last year, the company said that Gupta has been appointed as the CEO in line with the evolution needed to become a publicly listed company in 18-24 months. Before the announcement, there wasn't a CEO structure in place with the three co-founders divvying up responsibilities.\\n\\nUdaan has over 3 million registered users and 25,000-30,000 sellers across 900+ cities, according to the company’s website. The platform has over 1.7 million retailers, chemists, kirana shops, hotels/restaurants/caterers, and farmers carrying out over 4.5 million transactions a month.\",\n",
